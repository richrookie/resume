about_content: |
  Hi, my name is James Grant, I'm a full stack web developer with over 9 years experience currently specialising in React development.
  I am currently working for NatWest as a Lead Frontend Software Engineer on their comercial banking platform, Bankline.

  I enjoy making clean and interactive UI that is quick and easy to use whilst also giving users an enjoyable experience.
  I like working creating clean and efficient developer experiences to allow developers to focus on code quality and the end user experience.
  I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work
  with something new. The things that I currently have the most experience working with are:
  <mark>ES6 Javascript</mark>,
  <mark>React &amp; Redux</mark>,
  <mark>Node.js</mark>,
  <mark>Java</mark>,
  <mark>MySQL</mark>,
  <mark>SASS</mark>,
  <mark>git</mark> and
  <mark>AWS</mark>.

          A modern simple static resume template and theme. Powered by Jekyll and GitHub pages.

          This is a <mark>Jekyll</mark> theme that I have recently created, in fact it is what this resume has been built with.
          I decided I wanted to learn how to create a fully open source project and thought that this would be the perfect project to do this with.
          It has allowed me to share something I have created in a way that will be helpful for lots of people while also learning from this myself.

          The API for this site has been build using <mark>Node.js</mark> while the front end is a <mark>React</mark>/<mark>Redux</mark> app.
          I have used <mark>Docker</mark> to set up a development environment and <mark>Heroku</mark> to deploy and host the site. I have
          a suite of unit and API tests for the backend and unit tests for the front end.

          I have been using this project as a way to increase many of my skills and also learn new things, most recently sockets and Node.JS. I have particually
          enjoyed managing my own project and designing my own architecture and implementing this to a high standard.

          Feel free to check out the whole project on GitHub to get a feel for how I work [here](https://github.com/sproogen/itsgoingto.be).

          Taken accountability for the frontend of the payments product area within a commercial banking platform, becoming a go to for knowledge and technical decisions.

          Currently developing a new frontend architecture transforming the current monolithic frontend application into a scalable modular application with micro-frontends
          using Webpack Module Federation. This has been a great experience to develop a new workflow for developers to develop and release code and have input in all aspects
          of the development workflow.

          I have also been a key part of our frontend interview provess, I have worked to improve our interview process including writing new code tests, whilst interviewing
          candidates across multiple countries.

          Working at NatWest as a front end engineer focusing mostly on a corporate banking product called Bankline.
          Working as part of a scrum team consiting of 5 developers, 2 testers and a PO/BA I have the oportunity to help drive the team forwards and
          work with the PO defining what we are building.

          I spend most of my time working on a specifc area of a large application that our team take ownership over. The front end is a <mark>React</mark> app
          that talks to an API built using a collection of <mark>Java</mark> microservices. I have spent time working in multiple parts of the stack including
          helping to define our front end architecure to follow best practices to implementing PDF and CSV export in a microservice.

          Last year I took the lead on rebuilding the login journey to our application. I worked with the architects and designers to create something that would
          be fit for purpose and be easy to maintain for years to come. I then built this to a high standard which lead to a seamless switch over from the previous
          system with no issues. More recently I have acted as a consultant to external teams and application architects to advise on how we should be building new
          functionality within our application. I have also built reusable components to the same standards as opensource libraries which have been used by different teams across the bank.

          I enjoy learning about all areas of our application which allows me to be a go-to person for knowledge and queries within my team and the other teams
          in the office. I am always looking to suggest improvements and challenge what and how we are working to make sure we are delivering the best service
          to the customers while also developing to the highest standards.

          During my time at Simitive I worked as part of an agile team building our own in house web based software and
          also a large scale website for an international client. I gained experience working with a continuous integration
          workflow using tools such as <mark>Jenkins</mark> and working with Amazon Web Services for deployments. We built most
          of our software using <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Backbone</mark>, <mark>Marionette</mark>, <mark>Vue</mark> and <mark>Vuex</mark>.

          For 6 months I was working on delivering a standalone web product for an international client that services over
          600,000 users. This has been built from the ground up using <mark>Symfony</mark> to provide a backend API and
          <mark>Backbone</mark> for the front end. I also gained a lot of experience with <mark>Elasticsearch</mark> to provide
          search functionality of millions of entities to the front end. During the project I spent time out of hours
          communicating with the client, performing deployments and providing support.

          Towards the end of my time at Simitive my role involved assisting with the company's devOps, this included managing
          our <mark>AWS</mark> infrastructure as well as deploying and migrating sites. I also spent time configuring and maintaining
          our clients SSO, this mostly involves configuring new clients who are using <mark>AD FS</mark>, <mark>Shibboleth</mark> and
          <mark>CAS</mark> but also maintaining our software's SSO functionality.

          I was asked to update an existing Android app to the latest version of Android and to fix any issues caused by
          this as well as a few other existing issues. This project had a very tight time scale and I was able to complete
          it in very good time while providing regular updates to the client.

          While working at Nudge I was able to work on a large number of projects ranging from small Drupal sites to large
          enterprise level applications. I enjoy being able to work with clients to understand and surpass their expectations.
          At Nudge I was also given the oppertunity to work with all of my core skills and to gain new skills in things
          such as <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Angular</mark> and <mark>Gulp</mark>. I also worked on a number of <mark>iOS</mark> and
          <mark>Android</mark> applications.

          During my time at Nudge I was able to help the lead developer with the writing of Technical Specifications and
          also Project Requirements. I feel this is a useful skill to have as it helps me to become an even more well-rounded
          developer.

          During the summer I had the opportunity to head to Accra, Ghana and work with the team out there. This was a
          great opportunity to learn more about the industry in another country but also to allow me to lead their
          team for a few weeks and gain lots of experience of remote teams.

          I started working for GWS Media part time during my third year at University and continued full time once I had
          graduated. It was during this role that I learnt many of the fundamentals that I have been building on over
          the past 3 years. Whilst at GWS I had the opportunity to work with:
          <mark>Drupal</mark>, <mark>Magento</mark>, <mark>Bootstrap</mark>, <mark>Codeigniter</mark>, <mark>Android</mark> and <mark>iOS</mark>.

          I feel like having the opportunity to use a large range of different things early on in my career has given me
          the drive to always want to try new tools and frameworks.

          During my degree at Bristol University I learnt lots of key skills such as team work and project management. Although
          we mainly focused on software development and the principles of programming I use a lot of these skills to
          my advantage in my day to day work.

          While at Bristol Uni I spent a lot of my free time with the Kitesurfing society. I spent 3 years on the committee
          as a secretary, trip rep and then media and promotions manager. During this time I took on roles from organising
          transport and designing posters to organising a trip to Portugal for over 30 students.

      When I'm not sat at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. I do a lot a sports such as
      mountain biking, road cycling, kitesuring and horse riding as well as trying to make time for things like
      rock climbing and playing some rugby. I currently have 2 horses and find this is a great way to get out of the house
      and taking my mind of things while learing to showjump.

      I'm interested in photography and videography as I like to be creative, this is mainly through sport but
      I enjoy landscape and abstract photography too. I like to showcase my work on instagram if
      you would like to take a look - [jameswgrant](https://www.instagram.com/jameswgrant/).

      Finally during the rest of my free time you will either find me working on my bikes, rock climbing at one of
      Bristol's indoor climbing centres or down 'The Rec' supporting Bath Rugby.
